## Installing useful tools
> All steps must be run from the `/home/<user>` folder with `sudo` privileges. If you are going to customize or install as `root`, please set paths, folders and tools according to your new configuration.

1. Before continue, follow the my5G-core installation steps from [here](core-install.md)

2. Install some tools required to develop, monitor and containerize:

    System update
    ```
    sudo apt update && sudo apt -y upgrade
    ```
    Tools installation

    ```
    sudo apt -y install tcpdump wireshark curl snap
    ```
    Docker installation 

    ```
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```
    Docker-compose installation

    ```
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose

    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
    ```
    JetBrains GoLand IDE 

    ```
    sudo snap install goland --classic
    ```

## Opening the project in GoLand

1. Open the project with GoLand 
    - The project folder should be `~/my5G-core`

2. Check that **$GOPATH** and **$GOROOT** are recognized by GoLand and points to the right folders
    - Acess menus: File -> Settings
    - **$GOROOT** and **$GOPATH** should look like below:
    
    ![$GOROOT](../figs/go-setup_1.png)
    
    - **$GOPATH** should show your user instead of _my5G-core_
    
    ![2](../figs/go-setup_2.png)

3. Now, the IDE should be able to recognize the imports from external libraries and packages under `my5G-core/src/`
