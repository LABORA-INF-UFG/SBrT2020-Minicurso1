# Setting up development environment

## Installing useful tools

1. Before continue, follow the my5GCore installation steps from [here](https://github.com/LABORA-INF-UFG/my5Gcore)

2. Install some tools required to develop, monitor and containerize:
    -
    ```
    sudo apt update
    ```
    ```
    sudo apt -y install tcpdump wireshark curl snap
    ```
    ```
    curl -fsSL https://get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh && sudo sh get-docker.sh
    ```
    ```
    sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.25.4/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
    sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose && sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
    ```

    ```
    wget -q https://download.jetbrains.com/go/goland-2020.1.tar.gz
    ```

    ```
    sudo snap install goland --classic
    ```

## Opening the project in GoLand

1. Open the project with GoLand 
    - The project folder should be `~/go/src/free5gc`

2. Check that **$GOPATH** and **$GOROOT** are recognized by GoLand and points to the right folders
    - Acess menus: File -> Settings
    - **$GOROOT** and **$GOPATH** should look like below:
    
    ![$GOROOT](media/img/setup-dev-workflow-1.png)
    
    - **$GOPATH** should show your user instead of _ubuntu18_base_

3. Now, the IDE should be able to recognize the imports from external libraries and packages under `free5gc/src/`

## Running NF components in GoLand

1. On the Project View on the left, navigate through the component you want to run

![Selecionando o arquivo ".go" no projeto](media/img/setup-dev-workflow-3.png)

2. Right click on the component (*.go) and choose RUN
    - Optional: Use the CTRL + F9 (shortcut)

3. After this, the run window will show

![run](media/img/setup-dev-workflow-4.jpeg)


4. Now the “command” will be available on the toolbar

![5](media/img/setup-dev-workflow-5.png)

5. Next time just choose the command in the toolbar and run or debug clicking on the buttons

6. To stop a running or debugging component click the Stop button on the toolbar

Obs: Do the same for the other NF components. All the components are in `free5gc/src/{component}/{component}.go`. For example, SMF is in `free5gc/src/smf/smf.go`.

## Debugging

1. To start debugging some component since the beginning, you must set a breakpoint on the main function in the main package of the component.

    - For example, to start debugging the AUSF, set a breakpoint in the first line of code of the main function of the `free5gc/src/ausf/ausf.go` file.

## Steps to try out Ping

1. To setup development environment (With network interfaces and namespaces)
```
cd ~/go/src/free5gc
sudo ./setup_dev.sh up
```


2. Run the core (Runs UPF in namespace UPFns and other NFs in default namespace)
```
sudo ./run.sh
```


3. Run GoLand in UE namespace (Required to debug UE)
```
sudo ip netns exec UEns goland
# now you can debug the UE using the IDE
# on the running/debugging command you have to append the args --ping=5
# this args tells UE to run the ping routine
```


4. Monitor network traffic in UE with Wireshark
```
sudo ip netns exec UEns wireshark
# choose interface any
# useful filter to use in wireshark: ip.addr == 192.168.127.1 or ip.addr == 192.168.127.2 or ip.addr == 60.60.0.0/16 and !ssdp and !mdnp and !arp
```

5. Run UE on terminal
```
cd ~/src/go/free5gc
go build -o ./bin/ue -x src/ue/ue.go
sudo ip netns exec UEns ./bin/ue
```

6. To shutdown the interfaces and namespaces
```
cd ./go/src/free5gc/
sudo ./setup_dev.sh down
```
