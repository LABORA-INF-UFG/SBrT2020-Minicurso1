## Expected Result

This document explains how to debug network functions in my5G-core and presents tips to capture network traffic using filters based in the reference points targeted.

## Setting a break-point

1. To start debugging some component since the beginning, you must set a breakpoint on the main function in the main package of the component.

    - For instance, to start debugging the NRF, set a breakpoint in the first line of code of the main function of the `my5G-core/src/nrf/nrf.go` file.

    ![Setting break-point in NRF](../../media/images/code-debugging/set-break-point-nrf.png)

   1. package main
   2. Entry point for the application (_main_ function).
   3. Function _action_ is invoked in _main_.


## Running NF components in GoLand

1. On the Project View on the left, navigate through the component you want to run

    ![Select the Go lang file ".go" in the project](../../media/images/code-debugging/3.png)

2. Right click on the component (*.go) and choose Debug
    - Optional: Use the SHIFT + F9 (shortcut)

3. After this, the run window will show

    ![run](../../media/images/code-debugging/4.jpeg)


4. Now the “command” will be available on the toolbar

    ![5](../../media/images/code-debugging/5.png)

5. Next time just choose the command in the toolbar and run or debug clicking on the buttons

    ![6](../../media/images/code-debugging/6.png)

6. To stop a running or debugging component click the Stop button on the toolbar

    ![7](../../media/images/code-debugging/7.png)

Obs: Do the same for the other NF components. All the components are in `~/my5G-core/src/{component}/{component}.go`. For example, for SMF it's in `~/my5G-core/src/smf/smf.go`.

## Network traffic sniffing

1. Execute Wireshark 
   ```bash
   wireshark
   ````
2. Filters to use in Wireshark

    ```bash
    # monitor traffic going through UPF
    gtp

    # monitor traffic in NWu
    isakmp or gre or nas-5gs or esp

    # monitor traffic in N3
    pfcp

    # monitor traffic in N2
    ngap
    ```

    Here there is an overview of the most important protocols in service-based interfaces and reference points.

    ![5GS protocols](../../media/images/code-debugging/5gs-protocols.png)


3. Sample: monitoring PFCP traffic in N4 reference point.

    
    ```bash
    # stop all running NFs
    cd ~/my5G-core

    # start wireshark
    wireshark -kni any --display-filter pfcp &

    # run my5G-core
    ./run.sh
    ```

    ![PFCP wireshark sniffing](../../media/images/code-debugging/pfcp-wireshark.png)

    1. Establishing a PFCP Association between SMF and UPF. SMF will use this association to send rules to UPF, instructing how to process incomming packets.


## Monitoring  GTP5G tunnels

SMF uses the PFCP protocol to send rules to UPF and these rules instruct how UPF should process incomming packets.

1. Download and installing libgtp5gnl
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/PrinzOwO/libgtp5gnl.git ~/libgtp5gnl
    cd ~/libgtp5gnl
    autoreconf -iv
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`
    make
    ```
2. Listing packet processing rules
    ```bash
    cd ~/libgtp5gnl
    
    # monitoring Packet Detection Rule (PDR) tunnels
    sudo ./tools/gtp5g-tunnel list pdr

    # monitoring Forwarding Action Rule (FAR) rules
    sudo ./tools/gtp5g-tunnel list far
    ```

    ![Packet processing flow](../../media/images/code-debugging/packet-processing-rules.png)

    Images above were retrieved from the book 5G Core Networks.

3. Testing and monitoring packet processing rules
   ```bash
   # stop my5G-core if it's running (CTRL+C)

   # start wireshark sniffing for PFCP traffic (Split terminal)
   wireshark -kni any --display-filter pfcp &

   # the test will run UPF in another network namespace
   cd ~/libgtp5gnl   

   # monitoring Packet Detection Rule (PDR) rules (Split terminal)
   sudo watch -d -n 1 ip netns exec UPFns ./tools/gtp5g-tunnel list pdr

   # monitoring Forwarding Action Rule (FAR) rules (Split terminal)
   sudo watch -d -n 1 ip netns exec UPFns ./tools/gtp5g-tunnel list far

   # change the sleep time in ~/my5G-core/test.sh line 125 to 120 this will give you time to analyse the rules before the UPF is terminated.

   # execute TestNon3GPP
   cd ~/my5G-core
   sudo ./test.sh TestNon3GPP

   # observe the rules being created in UPF
   # Tip: You can combine the wireshark monitoring (pfcp) and inspect the packets to see how SMF sends the rules for packet processing to UPF   
   ```

    ![PFCP Session Establishment](../../media/images/code-debugging/pfcp-session-establishment.png)

   1. SMF instructs the UPF to create rules for packet detection and forwarding.
   2. Indicates the creation of a PDR.
   3. Specifies the rule ID.
   4. Tunnel Endpoint ID and IP address.
   5. UE IPv4 address.
   6. Information about how to desencapsulate incomming packet.

   OBS.: Check *conf/uerouting.yaml* file to see routing information for UE.


    ![GTP5G Tunnels in UPF](../../media/images/code-debugging/gtp5g-tunnels.png)

   1. Information to allow UPF to identify these packets
   2. The detection rule references a forwarding rule action to be executed when a packet matches this rule.
   3. Action = 2 means forward the packet. Other possible actions could be drop, duplicate or buffer.
   4. The detection rule that triggers this forwarding action.
